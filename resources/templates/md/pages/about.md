## I build Simple and Correct Software
### using typed and dynamic functional programming languages

My name is Oscar Felipe Toro, I am a software development based in Copenhagen. I am passionate about Software Engineering, Theoretical Computer Science and Functional Programming.

I am bachelor in Software Development from [KEA](http://www.kea.dk) and currently a graduate student at
[ITU in Copenhagen](https://www.itu.dk/Uddannelser/Kandidatuddannelser/Softwareudvikling#specialisering-programming-languages-advanced-computing)
where I am studying the Advanced Computing Track of the Master in Software Development. I am interested in
Applied Mathematics, Finance and Programming Languages, but I am specializing in the latter.

I am besides a classical musician. I hold a bachellor and a grade in Music Performance from Pontificia
Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile. I also [produce music](https://soundcloud.com/groovenino).

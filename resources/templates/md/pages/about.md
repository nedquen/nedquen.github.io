## Ñedquen
### bold software engineering, computer science and applied mathematics

The word "Ñedquen" is the occidental interpretation of a word that means something on the lines of courageous, brave and strong in Mapudungun, an old language spoken by the indigenous inhabitants of south-central Chile and southwestern Argentina. We are interested in sound engineering ideas and concepts that have the potential of improving the process of building software, always considering that good enough is enough. Inspired by the "design thinking" methodology, we believe in iterative improvements based on feedback and lessons learned considering different stages practised in a non-linear manner.
